# Neural Net examples

## Simple RNNs in practice
1. Let's create a simple neural net, with 2 hidden layers with Keras to solve a churn prediction problem
2. Lets do something similar for a regression problem

## Simple CNN in practice
Binary classification cnn, with 2 convolution layers and max pooling

## Simple LSTM in practice
Build an RNN with LSTM layers to predict stocks prices based on historical stock prices
